        <h1>JH Basta</h1>
        <p>
            For 2 years I was part of management for a local youth center, the organization already existed for many years, just without its own building.
            In those 2 years we were able to build what is probably the smallest, but still fully equipped, youth center in the country.
            Now that we had a full bar and toilets we were able to organize events at a much higher rate and lower cost. To this day JH Basta is still going strong.

        <p>
            During my last year of high school, I had to do a short 2-week internship.
            This is where I first started working at Euronav.
            After the internship I started working for them during summer until after a few years they offered me a full-time job.
            During my time with them I gathered experience on many aspects of both IT and international corporations.
            Ranging from setting up a new server in a rack, writing automated reports with data form a SQL server, 
            working with a backup to tape system, to installing a complete network on large vessels. And cable management...
