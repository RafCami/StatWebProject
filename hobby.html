            Old movies

                Nostalgia has become bigger than ever because of the internet.
                This is also the reason that I fell in love again with old, and most of the time terrible, movies.
                The internet wasn't as accessible yet, and living in a rural area we also didn't have cable tv.
                So the only alternative were the small video rental stores where I frequented multiple times a week.
            </p>
            <p>
                I mainly enjoy movies from around the 80's.
                This was the period of time when nothing was too crazy, but before the digital age so things were still done with practical effects.
                It's amazing to see what they were able to do in those days, often on just a shoestring budget.
                My personal favourite genres are sci-fi, action and horror.
                Even 40 years later many of these movies still hold up, and others are like a time capsule showing how much times have changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not only old movies I watch. There are also some real gems when it comes to mroe recent independant movies.
                But those are more often enjoyable to watch because they are terrible vanity projects for the director, who often also wrote the script AND has a major role in the movie, or are so bad it becomes funny.
                It's almost like some sort of schadenfreude.
                Following are some examples of fun movies.

            <h1>Video games</h1>
            <p>
                Ever since I was a child I've been really into video games.
                My first memories of gaming were on an old Atari console and Nintendo's NES, SNES and Gameboy.
                But it really started when I was 4 years old and I got a second hand Playstation 1 with a bunch of games.
            </p>
            <p>
                The year 1999 came around which would be formative for me.
                It's the year Pok√©mon red and blue came out for the Nintendo Gameboy.
                School couldn't be voer quick enough, even in the car ride home I would be playing religiously.
                Just by playing this game so much I learned English, even though no one in my family spoke it. 
                I vividly remember pronouncing cancel as "kankel" back then, with no one to correct me I assumed that was the right pronunciation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some years later I was skilled enough in working with a computer that I started to play games on that aswell.
                The ones coming to mind are the original Sims, Age of Mythology, Age of Empires.
                This was still long before I got internet access though.
            </p>
            <p>
                Skipping ahead about 2 years again, I finally had internet at home.
                So came the age of the flash games on often very sketchy looking websites.
                Leading to the next 'big' step, Runescape.
                This is kind of the stepping stone between the stupid flash games and the big online mmo's that followed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now came the time I started interacting with other people online.
                The world never felt both so small and so big.
                Never had I thought that I would be talking to people from around the globe just from behind my screen.
                And then sometimes you would come across someone on this vast network who lived almost just around the corner.
            </p>

                A friend of mine got me into playing World of Warcraft. They quit soon after, but i was hooked.
                It was here that I made a lot of long time friends and also learned many things.
                I played "competitive" for many years (e-sports wasn't a thing yet though).
                This thaught me communication during stressful moments, group management and also structured problem solving thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Video games are still my biggest hobby, and they definitely thaught me many usefull things.
